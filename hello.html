    "Hello, World!" program by Brian Kernighan (1978)
    A "Hello, World!" program is generally a computer program that ignores any input and outputs or displays a message similar to "Hello, World!".
    A small piece of code in most general-purpose programming languages, this program is used to illustrate a language's basic syntax. "Hello, World!" 
    programs are often the first a student learns to write in a given language,[1] and they can also be used as a 
    sanity check to ensure computer software intended to compile or run source code is correctly installed, and that its operator understands how to use it.
